# Air Quality Analysis and Vegetation Recommender
Topic-Optimizing urban green spaces for improved air quality and health
<br>
1. Problem Statement- <br>
        With rapid urbanization, cities are becoming more congested, leading to increased pollution, 
        reduced air quality, and health issues. Green spaces in urban environments have proven to 
        reduce air pollution, promote biodiversity, and offer mental and physical health benefits. 
        However, the distribution and optimization of urban green spaces in many cities are not 
        aligned with these objectives. This results in underutilized or poorly managed green spaces 
        that may fail to contribute significantly to improving air quality and promoting health in 
        urban areas. <br><br>
   Key challenges include: <br>
        • High air pollution levels in urban areas, contributing to respiratory issues, 
          cardiovascular diseases, and other health concerns.<br> 
        • Lack of data-driven decisions in the selection of plants and vegetation types to 
          maximize air purification benefits.<br>
        • Inefficient placement and management of green spaces within cities.<br>
<br>
2. Why This Problem Matters- <br> 
        With an increasing global population residing in cities, addressing urban air pollution and 
        promoting public health through environmental interventions is urgent. Urban green spaces 
        are widely recognized for their ability to act as “urban lungs,” filtering harmful pollutants 
        such as carbon monoxide, sulfur dioxide, and nitrogen dioxide. Enhancing these spaces can 
        lead to:<br> 
           • Improved Air Quality: Strategic use of specific plant types can enhance natural air 
             filtration.<br> 
           • Enhanced Public Health: Reduced air pollution can lead to fewer health issues, 
             benefiting the community’s well-being.<br> 
           • Better Urban Ecosystem: More biodiverse green spaces attract pollinators and other 
             species, contributing to the sustainability of urban ecosystems.<br>
<br>
<br>
3. Solution Overview- <br>
        This project aims to develop a data-driven approach for optimizing urban green spaces to 
        improve air quality and health. The solution includes using machine learning models to 
        analyze the influence of various factors (such as population density, pollution levels, climate, 
        and existing vegetation) on air quality improvement. Additionally, the solution provides 
        recommendations for vegetation types suited to specific conditions in different urban areas, 
        ensuring that plant selection is both scientifically supported and effective in addressing air 
        pollution challenges.

<br>
4. Project Objectives- <br> 
       • To create a predictive model that estimates air quality improvements based on 
         various urban parameters.<br> 
       • To identify the most effective plant species for air purification based on pollution 
         levels, climate, and other relevant conditions.<br> 
       • To generate actionable recommendations for urban planners and city officials for 
         enhancing existing green spaces and planning new ones.<br>

6. Conclusion and Future Work-<br><br> 
❖ Key Takeaways: By leveraging data science and machine learning, this project seeks to 
bridge the gap between urban planning and environmental health, contributing to 
healthier, more sustainable cities.<br> 
• Help cities make informed, data-driven decisions in their green space planning and 
management.<br> 
• Improve urban air quality and reduce health risks associated with pollution.<br> 
• Contribute to creating sustainable, livable, and healthier urban environments 
through optimized use of green spaces.<br><br> 
❖ Future Improvements:<br>
- Incorporating real-time data for continuous learning and continuous updation.<br>
- Expanding to a broader dataset covering multiple regions and cities<br>
